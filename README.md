# Motivate
## Running Motivate
Install rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs)

The model's parameters can be configured at config/parameters.yaml, and at
config/scenario.yaml

On the first run of the simulation run `cargo run --release -- --generate`,
so that social networks are generated.

Afterwards in the root of the repository run `cargo run --release`.

## Generating Documentation
Documentation can be generated by running `cargo rustdoc -- --document-private-items`
## Notes
As specified in .cargo/config the generated executable will target the cpu it is compiled on,
therefore binaries created on one system, may not execute on other systems, even if they run
the same operating system. To remove this requirement remove `-C target_cpu=native` from .cargo/config,
however this could have an impact on performance.
